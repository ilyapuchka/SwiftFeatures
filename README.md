# SwiftFeatures

This playground contains interesting features of Swift that I find while using it. The list is intended to be updated in future.

Contents:

1. Var in for-in loop
2. Property observers for local variables
3. ~= operator
4. Curried functions

If you have something you'd like to share, pull requests are welcome.
